# frontLeads
<h1>What it does</h1>
It helps normal civilians as well as volunteering or other hospital management organizations to come forward and help the masses with leads for COVID-19 resources and other necessary and essential commodities. Other users can also come forward and verify the leads that have been submitted by other users, thereby helping out the community as a whole. There is also a filtering panel that helps to filter the kind of resources that user might be searching for.
